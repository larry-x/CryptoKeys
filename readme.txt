[Overview]
CryptoKeys remembers your passwords and the login password in secret.txt, or 'the master key', which is located in the application folder. The login password used to get into the app is encrypted, and the entire document is again encrypted.

[Important Steps]
1. Remember your login password. Without coding knowledge of encryption it will be impossible to retrieve your passwords if you forget your login password.
2. Back up secret.txt and keep it safe. Even should your computer crash and burn, as long as have access to this application, 'the master key', and the login password, you can recover all your passwords.
3. Should you need to recover your passwords on a new machine, simply download this application, copy 'the master key' into the application folder, and boot up the program again.    

[Usage]
Password entries consist of a tag and the actual password. The tag can be a maximum of 42 characters and the password value can be a maximum of 64 characters. You may safely quit the program by x-ing out of it.

[More Users]
CryptoKeys was designed to be used by one person on one machine. If you have lots of passwords to store or multiple users, re-download CryptoKeys, rename the folder 'CryptoKeys 2' or whatever you like, and use as normal. When backing up 'the master key', it's okay to rename it, but when running the program, be sure to change the name back to secret.txt.
