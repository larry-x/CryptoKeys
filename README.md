## INSTRUCTIONS

Download "CryptoKeysDownload", change the folder name as you like, and execute the program.

### Overview
CryptoKeys tracks passwords, secret numbers, and whatever else you would like to remember. Everything is saved and encrypted in secret.txt. Except that someone has access to the source code and your secret.txt, it is impossible to break the encryption. If you regularly back up secret.txt, you can never lose your passwords.  

### Important Steps
1. Remember your login password. At present there is no mechanism to recover it.
2. Back up secret.txt and keep it safe. Even should your computer crash and burn, as long as have access to this application, secret.txt, and the login password, you can recover all your passwords.
3. Should you need to recover your passwords, simply download this application, put secret.txt into the same application folder, and boot up the program again.    

### Usage
Passwords are associated with a name, or 'tag'. When using the program for the first time, a new secret.txt document will be generated for you. Afterwards they should always be together in the same folder.

### More Users
CryptoKeys was designed to be used by one person on one machine. If you want to organize many passwords or want it to be used by multiple users, simply make another folder, copy in CryptoKeys.exe, name it 'CryptoKeys 2' or whatever you like, and use as normal. Be sure not to rename secret.txt.
